## Building

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 with C++ desktop development tools
- Windows SDK 10.0

### Setup (First Time or Fresh Worktree)

Before building, restore NuGet packages for the test suite:

```powershell
& "C:\Users\matto\Downloads\nuget.exe" restore
```

**Note:** The `packages/` directory is excluded from git. You must run `nuget restore` when setting up a fresh clone or worktree.

### Build

Use the Visual Studio build tasks in VS Code or MSBuild directly. See [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md) for detailed build commands and project targets.
